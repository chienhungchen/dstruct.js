#DStruct.js
####Version 0.0.2 - March 2012

A library of data structures that are common in many other languages. While the Google Closure library also has data structures, I am creating with the hopes that it will not overlap (too much).

##How To Use
Coming soon...after more of version 1.0.0 is done. Otherwise, read the source of test.html for now.

##Upcoming
Below are the data structures we plan to implement.

Version 1.0.0 will be complete when the following are implemented and tested: 
	
- Queue*
- Priority Queue
- Stack*
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Binary Search Tree
- Max Heap
- Binary Heap
- Min Heap
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph
- Directed Graph
- Map

\* = implemented

version 2.0.0 will be complete when the following are implemented and tested:

- Red-black tree

- And more to come...

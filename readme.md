#DStruct.js
##Description
Version 0.0.1
A library of data structures that are common in many other languages. I understand that the Google Closure library also has data structures. But I am hoping to not overlap (too much).

##Upcoming
Below are the data structures we plan to implement.

* = implemented

v1.0 will at least implement the follow: 
	Queue*
	Priority Queue
	Stack*
	Linked List
	Doubly Linked List
	Binary Search Tree
	Max Heap
	Binary Heap
	Min Heap
	Heap
	Hash Table
	Graph
	Directed Graph
	Map
	
v2 will start to implement other less commonly used data structures:
	AVL Tree
	Red-black tree
	Splay Tree
	...will finish later

##License
Anyone can use this.

#DStruct.js
####Version 0.0.1 - March 2012

A library of data structures that are common in many other languages. I understand that the Google Closure library also has data structures. But I am hoping to not overlap (too much).

##How To Use
Coming soon...after more of version 1.0.0 is done. Otherwise, read the source of test.html for now.

##Upcoming
Below are the data structures we plan to implement.

Version 1.0.0 will be complete when the following are implemented and tested: 
	
- Queue*
- Priority Queue
- Stack*
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Binary Search Tree
- Max Heap
- Binary Heap
- Min Heap
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph
- Directed Graph
- Map

\* = implemented

version 2.0.0 will be complete when the following are implemented and tested:

- AVL Tree
- Red-black tree
- Splay Tree
- And more to come...

#DStruct.js
####Version 0.0.1

A library of data structures that are common in many other languages. I understand that the Google Closure library also has data structures. But I am hoping to not overlap (too much).

Version 1.0.0 will be complete when the following are implemented and tested: 
	
	- Queue*
	- Priority Queue
	- Stack*
	- Linked List
	- Doubly Linked List
	- Binary Search Tree
	- Max Heap
	- Binary Heap
	- Min Heap
	- Heap
	- Hash Table
	- Graph
	- Directed Graph
	- Map
	
version 2.0.0 will be complete when the following are implemented and tested:

	- AVL Tree
	- Red-black tree

	- And more to come...

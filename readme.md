#DStruct.js
####Version 0.0.1

A library of data structures that are common in many other languages. I understand that the Google Closure library also has data structures. But I am hoping to not overlap (too much).

	- Queue*
	- Priority Queue
	- Stack*

	- Max Heap
	- Binary Heap
	- Min Heap
	- Heap
	- Hash Table

version 2.0.0 will be complete when the following are implemented and tested:

The idea of the project is to provide javascript users with a set of data structures that you usually see in many other programming languages such as Java and C#.
Some may argue that this is not useful because you can always build your own, and that's true, but we just want to do it.

For our first version, the data structures will be a part of one giant file: structs.js (later to rename as dstruct.js or dstructs.js)
Following versions will start to break the data structures out into separate files, where you can host on your server and pull only the files you need to help speed up load time

Below are the data structures we plan to implement.


* = implemented

v1.0 will at least implement the follow: 
	Queue*
	Priority Queue
	Stack*
	Linked List
	Doubly Linked List
	Binary Search Tree
	Max Heap
	Binary Heap
	Min Heap
	Heap
	Hash Table
	Graph
	Directed Graph
	Map
	
v2 will start to implement other less commonly used data structures:
	AVL Tree
	Red-black tree
	Splay Tree
	...will finish later
